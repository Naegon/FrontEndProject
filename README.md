# FrontEndProject
*4th year front end project at Efrei Paris*

## Topic
Your goal for this project is to build a client application that leverages [publicly available APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). You can choose as many public API you want. Try to build something new and useful, with a real added value.

## Rules
- This is a group work (3 or 4 students per team).
- Use Angular or React. Material design is not mandatory.
- Use [this](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) git workflow model (at least master and develop branches).
- I will check you commit, and when.
- Use eslint. Recommended configuration is in [practical works](https://thomas-veillard.fr/front-end-web-development/practical-works/setup-your-practical-work-environment/).
- Delivery
- Your git repository is your delivery. Just share read-only access with me (my Github username is TruffeCendree).

## Bonuses
Host your static website online (ex. Firebase Hosting, render.com, aws S3…).   
Monitor client side errors in production (ex. Sentry, Rollbar, Stackdriver…).
