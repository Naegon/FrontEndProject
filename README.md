# FrontEndProject
*4th year front end project at Efrei Paris*

## Topic
Your goal for this project is to build a client application that leverages publicly available APIs. You can choose as many public API you want. Try to build something new and useful, with a real added value.

## Rules
This is a group work (3 or 4 students per team).
Use Angular or React. Material design is not mandatory.
Use this git workflow model (at least master and develop branches).
I will check you commit, and when.
Use eslint. Recommended configuration is in practical works.
Delivery
Your git repository is your delivery. Just share read-only access with me (my Github username is TruffeCendree).

## Bonuses
Host your static website online (ex. Firebase Hosting, render.com, aws S3…).
Monitor client side errors in production (ex. Sentry, Rollbar, Stackdriver…).
